# No separate pip-install or schema-reconcile step here (the bare-metal
# version of this script had both). Both are handled automatically now:
#  - dependency changes: `docker compose build` COPYs requirements.txt before
#    RUN pip install, so Docker's own layer cache already skips the reinstall
#    when it's unchanged and redoes it when it is — no manual diffing needed.
#  - schema reconciliation (db_validator.validate_and_fix): runs on every
#    app startup inside the container itself (see main.py), so it happens
#    automatically whenever the new container starts below.
#
# chown is also gone. The bare-metal version chowned the whole tree to
# www-data because that's who ran the process. The container runs as its own
# appuser (uid 1000) baked into the image — code files are COPYd in at build
# time regardless of host ownership. The only host ownership that matters is
# on the bind-mounted uploads/backups/static/stress_reports dirs, and those
# only need to be uid 1000 once, not on every deploy (set during the Docker
# cutover on 2026-10-01 — see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-docker-containerization-design.md).
