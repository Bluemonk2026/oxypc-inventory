"""
WorkID Status — consolidated view of every WorkID (WorkOrder) with the tag's
Asset History (Stage/Completed Date/Assigned Engineer sourced from a
StageMovement — From/When/By respectively), an IQC→Final-QC timeline, and
filters (workid, tag number, engineer, date range).

Each WorkID is matched to ITS OWN StageMovement, not just the device's
overall latest one (2026-09-02 backfill): a WorkOrder is closed at almost
the same instant the movement that closes out its stage is recorded (see
routers/cosmetic.py advance_stage), so for a completed WorkOrder we pick the
StageMovement for that device whose moved_at is nearest to
WorkOrder.completed_at, out of ALL of that device's Asset History records —
not only its most recent one. A device with several WorkIDs across several
historical stages therefore shows each one's own correct Stage/Completed
Date/Engineer instead of every row collapsing onto the single latest
movement. A still-pending WorkOrder (no completed_at yet) has no closing
movement to match, so it falls back to the device's latest movement as the
best available "where things stand" hint.

2026-09-02 through 2026-09-24 this page also "backfilled" one row per
WorkOrder-less StageMovement (most StageMovements never get a WorkOrder —
bulk stage moves, IQC intake, Final QC pass/fail, etc.), so a tag that
completed a stage with no engineer assignment wasn't invisible here. Removed
2026-09-24 at the user's explicit request: matching a WorkOrder to "its own"
closing movement is inherently a single best-guess pick (closest StageMovement
by timestamp), and a WorkOrder that legitimately has TWO associated movements
(e.g. assignment-time + completion-time — repair.py's l1_pick "Picked by..."
vs. l1l2_complete_to_stress's closing movement) could only ever have one of
them matched, leaving the other to backfill in as a confusing "— No WorkID —"
duplicate of the real row right next to it. This page now shows exactly one
row per real WorkOrder — nothing else — trading away visibility into
WorkOrder-less transitions for never showing a phantom duplicate.

2026-09-19 — Aging/Completed Date redefined to be per-WorkID. Completed
Date only shows once the WorkID is genuinely done (WorkOrder.completed_at
set) -- a still-open WorkOrder (tag still with the same engineer, not yet
handed off to another stage/assignee) shows blank rather than falling back
to the device's latest, possibly-unrelated StageMovement as a "best guess".
Aging is a running day-count from Assigned Date: it keeps counting up every
day the WorkID stays open, then freezes at whatever it reached the moment
the WorkID is genuinely completed -- it is never blank.

"Exclude Admin" filter (2026-09-02) drops rows whose engineer (the
underlying StageMovement.moved_by / WorkOrder.assigned_username, not the
rendered display name) belongs to an admin-role User — resolved once per
request, not by string-matching a display name. CSV export (2026-09-02)
was narrowed to exactly Tag Number / Lot Number / Make / Model / Engineer
Name / Stage / Assigned Date / Completed Date; Lot Number is looked up once
across every device appearing in `items`.
