"""Daily Report — the Daily Stock exports (Overall / Tag Based / Location Based)
generated automatically every day at 9:00 PM and kept as downloadable files.

Files live under uploads/daily_stock_reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/{overall,tags,location}.csv
(uploads/ is the persistent bind mount in the Docker deployment, so reports
survive redeploys). No database table: the folder IS the index, which keeps
this out of the schema. A report is listed only when all three files exist.

The generated content is exactly what the Daily Stock page's own exports produce
for that date (routers.reports.build_*_csv), so it follows the same rules
(Opening / Closing = Opening - the day's sales, no sold / GRN rows, no
deactivated or trashed tags, sales by Sale Date).

A 9 PM file is a snapshot: sales dated that day but keyed in later (after 9 PM,
or back-dated entries made the next day) are not in it. Days before the feature
existed were generated afterwards from the Stage Movement log (see backfill).
