"""Resolve the Lot behind a Buyer Deal.

A sales opportunity has no lot foreign key — it is created by Marking Won a
partner bid, and the bid is what carries the lot. Both the Buyer Deal detail
page (which shows the Lot Number) and the quote builder (which fills line items
from that lot's stock) need the same lookup, so it lives here rather than being
written twice and drifting apart.
