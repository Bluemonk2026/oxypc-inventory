"""Model Based Summary and Lot Based Summary (templates/devices/list.html) —
the two client-side tables on the "All Inventory" page below the main
#devicesTable — moved onto the Global Table module 2026-09-03. #devicesTable
itself was already on it; this closes the "All Inventory (All tables)" gap.

Each table's old custom header search box is gone, replaced by
initGlobalTable's own toolbar search box:
  - Model Based Summary's old box only ever searched the Model Names column
    (dtModel.column(0).search(...)) — preserved via searchable:false on
    every other column, so the relocated box can't start matching
    Make/Device Type/counts too.
  - Lot Based Summary's old box searched every column (dtLot.search(...),
    a plain global search) — no restriction needed, initGlobalTable's own
    box reproduces that as-is. Its placeholder also carried a copy-pasted
    "Search Model Names…" string (should always have said "Search Lots…")
    — fixed in passing since the whole input was already being touched.
